- Simple tool to copy the current working directory to clipboard from the terminal, intended for Bash shell. This is not a completed work. Still this should be wrapped in a functon.

- Inspired by `copydir` for ZSH. https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/copydir/copydir.plugin.zsh

- Requirement: `xclip` - get it from `apt-get install xclip`
